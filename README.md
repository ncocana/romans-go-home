## Introduction

This is a kata in Java proposed by our teacher with the purpose to practise regular expressions and enum types.

**Link of the kata** [Romans Go Home](https://github.com/dfleta/romans-go-home).  

## About the kata

The program transforms numbers in roman notation into indo-arabic notation.   

The test cases and the main app were writed by my tutor, [dfleta](https://github.com/dfleta/romans-go-home/tree/master/src). The logic to solve the kata was writed by me.
